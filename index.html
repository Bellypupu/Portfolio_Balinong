							<h2>Weekly Journal</h2>
							<div class="large-box">
								<h3>Week 1 (May 22 - May 24)</h3>
								<h5>During our first orientation at STMicroelectronics Calamba, we were introduced to the company's background and its general operations. On the second day, Ma'am Jovy from HR guided us on a tour inside the company, where we met various staff and employees, including our supervisor, who gave us an overview of their roles. By the third day, Ma'am Jovy introduced our team and our supervisor, Ma'am Joyce. Ma'am Joyce then provided a thorough tour of the DTIT department, setting the stage for our experience there.</h5>
								<h3>Week 2 (May 27 - May 31)</h3>
								<h5>Since we still do not have a project, we observed and learned from the DTIT team, understanding how crucial the IT department is to our operations. Our supervisor introduced us to various team members and explained their work cycle from start to finish, giving us a clear picture of their roles. We also delved deeper into the production operation, observing the team as they handled calls from other departments. This hands-on experience was invaluable in understanding the practical aspects of production. Finally, our supervisor outlined our training plan as interns, including the projects that will be assigned to us, which made us feel excited and prepared for the learning journey ahead.</h5>
								<h3>Week 3 (June 3 - June 7)</h3>
								<h5>For the whole week, without proper equipment, we studied what to do when we start the project. Today, our supervisor introduced us to our project advisor for the web application, who provided an overview of the project objectives and their importance to our operations. We had our first detailed discussion about the web application project, focusing on CRUD functionality and best practices for efficient and user-friendly interfaces. Our advisor also helped us outline the search functionality, discussing keyword and filter use for specific articles and procedures. Additionally, we focused on the Python script data loader component, learning about reading data from a CSV file, data validation, and error handling to automate data loading and ensure integrity.</h5>
								<h3>Week 4 (June 10 - June 14)</h3>
								<h5>We accomplished a loading page and designed the UI, but there are still no functions as Java and Spring Boot are quite difficult to understand, especially since the MVC framework is new to us. Our laptops were installed with an old version of a Java IDE and the Spring Boot framework, making it hard to start the project. We had a weekly meeting to discuss our progress, and for the whole day, we studied Java and the Spring Boot framework from scratch. To make any progress, we approached an employee in the DTIT department, whom our supervisor recommended, for guidance on the project.</h5>
								<h3>Week 5 (June 17 - June 21)</h3>
								<h5>For this week, I focused on managing and validating data for our project, following significant changes announced by our supervisor during our weekly meeting. We transitioned to using Visual Studio Code as our primary programming environment. I have a total of eight tables in the Oracle database to fill, with three main tables and five automated history tables. Using the Excel file provided by my supervisor, I validated and inserted data for the first table, which was straightforward. I then began the data insertion process for the second table.</h5>
								<h3>Week 6 (June 24 - June 28)</h3>
								<h5>I continued working on the second table, which has the most complicated validations, focusing on correctly inserting primary and foreign keys. This task took me a whole week to finish, and I encountered several issues that required additional research on YouTube and other sources to understand primary key management. Although I skipped the ID insertion for now due to its complexity, I began inserting other data using loops. Despite these challenges, I reported my progress to our supervisor and received project advice, making steady</h5>								
								<h3>Week 7 (July 1 - July 5)</h3>
								<h5>This week, I focused on studying how to retrieve images from the Excel file, but encountered some errors. During our weekly report with the supervisor, I received project advice and began validating data for the third table, successfully accomplishing the loader and inserting primary and foreign keys. However, I had to revisit and modify the code for the second table to create an additional list for Article Activity IDs. After resolving these issues, I inserted all fields into the third table, ensuring all tables now have their corresponding data. With the CSV data correctly inserted, I plan to create a local directory to retrieve and save images from the Excel file.</h5>
								<h3>Week 8 (July 8 - July 12)</h3>
								<h5>I accomplished everything for the data loader, making it ready for the web application my partner is developing. Our supervisor held a meeting to prepare us for tomorrow's final presentation, guiding us on what to expect and how to prepare. I successfully managed to get images from the Excel file into a local directory, but I'm still working on organizing the image names, which involves coordinating three primary keys and fixing the arrangement of IDs. In the morning, our supervisors conducted a mock presentation to ensure we were prepared. By 2 PM, we began the final presentation with all the supervisors and department employees, successfully showcasing our project and even receiving an offer for an extension.</h5>
